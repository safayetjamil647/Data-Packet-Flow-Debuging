What is ip address and its range

Data Packet Flow Example

What is Ingress 

Data ingress refers to traffic that comes from outside an organization’s network and is transferred into it. It is unsolicited traffic that gets sent from the internet to a private network. The traffic does not come in response to a request made from inside an organization’s network. 

What is Egress

A common egress meaning is the process of data leaving a network and transferring to an external location. Data egress is a form of network activity but poses a threat to organizations if it exposes sensitive data to unauthorized or unintended recipients.

Egress happens whenever data leaves an organization’s network, be it via email messages, as uploads to the cloud or websites, as a file transferred onto removable media like Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives and external hard drives, or through File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) transfers.
